# CS203G5 frontend
We are a group of Singapore Managment University students who is undertaking Collaborative Software Development and this is our front end of our project. 

<b>Problem Statement</b> <br>
The ever changing Covid-19 restrictions brings about inconvenience to us on a daily basis and especially for the HR managers, they will have to manage the whole company, ensuring that a specified number of employees can resume back to the office. With this in mind, how can we alleviate the tedious management system of these HR managers with the help of our solution?
